The meatball, in this context, is being presented as something that would cause the spaghetti to blush due to its \"nakedness\" or other suggestive implications.  Blushing is a physical reaction to embarrassment or arousal.\\n\\nTherefore, the humor comes from the unexpected and slightly risqué suggestion that the spaghetti is blushing because it has seen something inappropriate (the meatball).
